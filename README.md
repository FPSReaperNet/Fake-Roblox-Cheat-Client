# Fake RobloxInjector Script
-# Made by omega
(Yes I used ChatGPT for README.md)
## Description
This batch script simulates a series of system errors and fake alerts, mimicking actions such as webcam access warnings, file deletions, and fake system failures. The script is designed for educational purposes only and should **not** be used on systems without permission.

## Features
- Simulates system errors etc..
- Displays fake security alerts like Oh No YoUr FiReWaLl Is DyInG but a little more realistic
- Mimics file deletion attempts
- Simulates a fatal error and shuts down the PC

## Usage
1. Ensure you have permission to run the script on the system (Its not used for revenge).
2. Run the script as an administrator to see the effects (It will check if its administrator and require it).
3. Type `[YES]` to simulate injection and run it or `[NO]` to exit. HAS TO BE CAPITALS
4. Always Check the code before running it.. Dont make my mistake of deleting system 32 once..
5. Why? I forgot to remove del system 32 and nearly erased my personal pc without testing out the fake loading screen..

## Warning
This script is purely for testing and learning. Running it on a production system can cause issues, including unintended system errors. Always back up your data before executing scripts.
